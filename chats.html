				Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon (also known as Ciri), was born in 1253 or 1252[2], and most likely during the Belleteyn holiday. She is the Princess of Cintra, the daughter of Pavetta and Emhyr var Emreis (who was using the alias "Duny" at the time) as well as Queen Calanthe's granddaughter.

After Geralt of Rivia helped lift Duny's curse, Duny asked what reward the witcher would like and Geralt proclaimed the Law of Surprise, as it turned out Pavetta was pregnant with Ciri, unbeknownst to Duny. Six years to the day after the child's birth, Geralt went back to Cintra for her, but did not take her with him to Kaer Morhen at that time. In fact, he didn't even lay eyes on her and only spoke with Calanthe, who divulged no information to him, not even the child's gender.

While she was still an infant, Ciri's parents were both lost in a storm at sea and were presumed dead. She spent her youth in Cintra and Skellige under the care of her grandmother and her uncle.
